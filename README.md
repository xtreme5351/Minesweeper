# Minesweeper
My version of a minesweeper solver.

The logic for the solver is currently under development.
In the meantime, do enjoy the minesweeper board I built.

This board is extremely basic and has a limit of 100 squares as the formatting of the board breaks down for values after.
Either way, the board is not the most important element of this project. The logic behind the solver is.

Thanks!
